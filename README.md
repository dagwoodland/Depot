# Depot
## Description
Depot is a game about sorting parcels quickly, parcels come in on conveyor belts at ever increasing speeds. If the conveyor belts run out of space parcels begin to get damaged. If a conveyor belt only contains damaged parcels and is full it could jam, and you lose the game. This game was made for Ludum Dare 42 Compo "Running out of space"  and made in 48 hours.

## How To Play
**Aim**

The aim of the game is to keep all the conveyor belts free of parcels, by dragging and dropping parcels. If a conveyor belt “runs out of space” for parcels, some parcels will start to become damaged. If all the parcels on a full conveyor belt are damaged the conveyor belt could jam, and you lose the game.
**Sorting Parcels**
To get a good score you must correctly sort the parcels, the sorting rules are as follows:
* If a parcel looks damaged it must always be put in the damaged chute.
* If a parcel isn’t damaged, but weighs more than 5kg it must be put in the too heavy chute.
* If a parcel isn’t too heavy or damaged, it must go in the normal chute, unless it has a red stamp which must go in the priority chute.

The game will tell you what you did wrong if you make a mistake, so you should get the hang of it. :)
